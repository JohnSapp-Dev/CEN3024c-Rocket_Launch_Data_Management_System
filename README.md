# Rocket Launch Data Management System
This class project is meant to teach the SDLC from start to finish.
Throughout the class, we have gone through the following steps of the SDLC:
- Defining program requirements
- Developing an implementation plan
- Designing a test plan
- Coding phase 1 -- Logic & input validation 
- Coding phase 2 -- Testing
- Coding phase 3 -- Adding GUI 
- Coding phase 4 -- Adding database support
- Project complete <- current state

## Program description
The Rocket Launch Data Management System (RLDMS) allows users to enter data describing a rocket launch 
via a text (.txt) file or manual entry. The user can then read the saved data, update an entry, delete an entry, or calculate the 
total tonnage launched to orbit. The final program will allow the user to interact with the program via a GUI and all data will be 
stored in a MySQL database that runs on the user's local machine.
